The new Tiled website went live today, mentioning some of the features added
in past 8 years and highlighting a few awesome games made with Tiled!

Indeed, the [last update to the site's design][2013-website] was exactly 8
years ago. It was about time for a more modern look and to update the
presentation of Tiled's features, many of which did not exist when the
previous website was set up. I had a lot to learn about new HTML and CSS
features and making design decisions isn't easy either, especially when it
should also work well on mobile, but I'm happy with how it turned out!

I've added [a showcase][showcase] with some great games made with Tiled. There
are many out there (over 300 [games made with Tiled][made-with-tiled] are
listed just on itch.io) so it's a bit hard to choose which ones to show. I
tried to pick the most well-known ones. Let me know if your game should be
among them!

Finally the new site brings the latest news posts back to the top and also
adds a link to the recently registered [official Twitter handle][twitter]. If
you're [following me][twitter-bjorn] but are mostly interested in updates
about Tiled, be sure to give [@TiledApp][twitter] a follow!

Now let's hope the new website will last us for at least another 8 years! :-)
